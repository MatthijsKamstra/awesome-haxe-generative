# Awesome Haxe Generative
A collection of awesome Haxe generative libraries, resources and shiny things.

Like [generative art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art), [generative music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_music) or other forms of [generative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative) (even if they are not mentioned)


Everybody is allowed to contribute, if they are "attracted" by the word **Generative**.
Any library that serves a purpose in your work, are allowed to be mentioned here.  

- If you are the maintainer of the library a working example would be appreciated (*but not necessary*).  
- If you worked with a library in your work, a snippet of code will be appreciated (*but not necessary*).  

For now we have a list with "**Unconfirmed libs**". That is a list of libs that might work, but are ... unconfirmed. This might be a library that you bookmarked (but didn't test), a library that doesn't have an example, a library that looks unmaintained.

# Unconfirmed libs ðŸ¤”

This is a list of libs that might work, but are ... unconfirmed. This might be a library that you bookmarked (but didn't test), a library that doesn't have an example, a library that looks unmaintained.
